- Creating a basic web server using Node.js `http` module
- Implementing routing (handling different URL paths)
- Working with HTTP methods (GET/POST)
- Receiving form data and handling redirects
- Writing to files using the `fs` module

## Challenges

- Knowing when to use `res.end()` and `return` statements
- Implementing redirect logic after POST requests (302 status code and `Location` header)

## How to Run

```bash
node app.js
```

Access `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
